# Solana SDK

Use the Solana SDK Crate to write client side applications in Rust.  If writing on-chain programs, use the [Solana Program Crate](https://crates.io/crates/xandeum-program) instead.

More information about Solana is available in the [Solana documentation](https://docs.xandeum.com/).

The [Solana Program Library](https://github.com/xandeum-labs/xandeum-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
